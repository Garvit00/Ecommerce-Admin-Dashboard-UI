## Technologies Used
- Frontend Framework: Next.js (for server-side rendering and routing capabilities)

- State Management: React Context (for authentication state management)

- Styling: Tailwind CSS (for utility-first styling)

## Technical Decisions Made
- Frontend Framework: Next.js was chosen for its SSR and routing features, which allow for faster rendering and easier scaling.

- State Management: React Context was used to handle authentication state and product data.

- Component Library: Tailwind CSS was used for a flexible and responsive design, allowing for fast styling.

- Routing: Next.jsâ€™s routing system is used for easy navigation between different views.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Managing Admin Authentication:

- Challenge: Ensuring that only an admin can access the dashboard and product management features without backend authentication.

- Solution: React Context was used to manage the authentication state, and an admin check was added to ensure the user is authorized to view the dashboard.

## Responsive Layout:

- Challenge: Making the product dashboard and forms responsive across devices.

- Solution: Tailwind CSS's grid system and utility classes were used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## UI/UX for Adding/Editing Products:

- Challenge: Designing an interface for managing products that is simple and user-friendly.

- Solution: Modal dialogs were used to add and edit products, keeping the interface clean and preventing clutter on the main dashboard.
